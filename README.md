## Introduction

The Project is a full-stack web application that combines a robust backend powered by Next.js API with a MongoDB database, providing a modern and efficient solution. This project offers a feature-rich dashboard for users, including components for user profiles, movie information, and user account management.

## Features

### Dashboard

The dashboard is a central component of the project, offering a dynamic and personalized experience for users. It includes features such as user-specific data display, a movie search functionality, and user details. This component interacts with the project's API to fetch and display user and movie data.

### Edit Page

The edit page allows users to modify their profile information, including details like name, address, gender, phone, and origin. Users can also upload a profile picture. This component is user-friendly and ensures a smooth experience for users to update their information.

### Movie Detail Page

The movie detail page displays comprehensive information about a specific movie, including its title, rating, year of release, genre, plot, and more. It fetches movie data from an external API and provides users with a detailed overview of their selected movie.

### Profile Page

The profile page displays user information, such as name, email, address, gender, phone, and origin. Users can view their profile data and also have the option to delete their account through this component.
